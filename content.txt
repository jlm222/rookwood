In the heart of rural Kent, this attractive holiday cottage is ideally placed for exploring the area, and just a short drive from the coast. It stands in the owners’ beautiful landscaped grounds, complete with shared outdoor swimming pool and a lake where guests can picnic, yet is detached and secluded with its own terrace. There is a delightful sun room which overlooks the swimming pool and grounds, and is the perfect place in which to relax with a good book. Renovated to a high standard with terracotta-tiled floors and large first floor bedroom, it makes a cosy base for a couple or a family. Tenterden with many antique shops, medieval Rye, Battle, and Tunbridge Wells for shopping are all easily reached. On the coast are New Romney and Hythe, with Folkstone and Dover just an hour away for day trips to France. Shops and pub 2½ miles.
