My design for a holiday cottage website: rookwoodloge.com 

The owner already is already established on booking websites with reviews so it's mainly just a landing page that links to booking sites.

However, it has been great practice for my front-end design skills, I've recently added a lot of animations via JS and the intersection observer, and I plan to implement more features in the future such as parallax images and a swipable gallery, along with basic improvements to the look and feel of the site.
